/**
 * The survey, done by the customer.
 *
 * Custom Showers does not visit before cutting. The numbers typed into this
 * configurator are the numbers the glass is made to, and toughened glass
 * cannot be trimmed afterwards — so a measurement that is 5mm out is a new
 * panel, not an adjustment.
 *
 * Two ideas run through this module, and both exist because the person
 * holding the tape is standing in their own bathroom and has never done this
 * before:
 *
 * 1. Never ask them to *judge* anything. "Is that wall plumb, and which way
 *    does it lean?" is a question people answer badly and confidently. Two
 *    tape readings against a vertical reference — the gap at the bottom and
 *    the gap at the top — give the same answer arithmetically, and the sign
 *    of the difference supplies the direction for free.
 *
 * 2. Derive whatever can be derived. The width at the top is the width at
 *    the bottom minus however far the walls lean in, so there is no reason to
 *    send someone up a ladder for a number we already know. It is offered as
 *    an optional check, not asked for as a measurement.
 *
 * ## Runs
 *
 * An enclosure is measured as one straight *run* per wall it follows: an
 * inline screen is one run, an L-shaped corner is two, a three-sided
 * enclosure is three. Each run gets its own widths and its own floor fall,
 * because a corner shower turns into a different room halfway along.
 *
 * Only the two ends of the whole chain meet walls. Every other end is a
 * glass-to-glass corner, and glass sets its own vertical there — so a middle
 * run's top width should equal its floor width.
